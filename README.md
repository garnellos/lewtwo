## What's special about litwo?
litwos core design ideas are:

**Be accessible**: No logging in, no signing up, as little boilerplate as possible while keeping a reasonable amount of functionality. Be easy and intuitive to pick up and start using.

**Save any data locally**: All data that is processed through litwo is saved locally through IndexedDB and not uploaded to any cloud, server or SAAS provider. Local export to a JSON file is possible for backups and exchange.

**Divide and conquer**: Any task can split up into an infinite number of subtasks, and so on. You don't have to stick to any categories given by software &ndash; just build any hierarchy that suits you and your workflow.
