# Lightweight Task and Work Organizer (lewtwo)

lewtwo is a software for task and work organization that runs in any browser and does not need to be installed, deployed or hosted through a server. Just download, open, and you're good to go.

lewtwo is available through the terms of the GNU GPL-2.0 license.

Thank you, please enjoy using lewtwo!

## Principles
lewtwos core design principles are:

### Be easy to use
No logging in, no signing up, as little boilerplate as possible, just be easy and intuitive to pick up and start using.

### Save any data locally
All data that is processed through lewtwo is saved locally through IndexedDB and not uploaded to any cloud, server or SAAS provider. Local export to a JSON file is possible for backups and exchange.

### Divide and conquer
Any task can split up into an infinite number of subtasks, and so on. You don't have to stick to any categories given by software &ndash; just build any hierarchy that suits you and your workflow.
